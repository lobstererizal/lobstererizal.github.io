## And I love watching movies (iconic ones)

Here's my top 3 favorite movies :

 1.)   ![alt text](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/19/5c/5f/195c5f69d51c1a797aecfa9758666598.jpg)
 
The story follows Elle Woods (Witherspoon), a sorority girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Davis) by getting a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard Law School, and in the process, overcomes stereotypes against blondes and triumphs as a successful lawyer.

2.) ![alt text](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/d4/ab/45/d4ab4597bc2cedac5bc3d2b2a603aaa2.jpg)

The movie follows Cloe, Sasha, Yasmin and Jade as they go through high school. After being broken up on the first day, Yasmin decided to take the initiative and bring her group back together and show Meredith and her Girl Posse that she doesn't rule the school.

3.) ![alt text](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ac/63/0d/ac630d94a646330f14f201ddf299b989.jpg)
In the film, ex-LAPD officer Brian O'Conner and his friend Roman Pearce (Gibson) go undercover for the United States Customs Service and the FBI to apprehend drug lord Carter Verone (Hauser) in exchange for the erasure of their criminal records.
